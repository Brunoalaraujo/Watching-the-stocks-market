# Watching-the-stocks-market
Manipulating and creating SQLite databases with beginner and intermediate queries

Project from Codecademy;

Project Objectives:

You are asked by a company to help them make more informed decisions on investments. To start, you will be watching the stock market, collecting data, and identifying trends!

Project Tasks:

•	Beginner queries

1.	What are the distinct stocks in the table?
2.	Query all data for a single stock. Do you notice any overall trends?
3.	Which rows have a price above 100? Between 40 to 50? Less than 30?
4.	Sort the table by price. What are the minimum and maximum prices?

•	Intermediate queries

1.	Explore using aggregate functions to look at key statistics about the data (e.g., min, max, average).
2.	Group the data by stock and repeat. How do the stocks compare to each other?
3.	Group the data by day or hour of day. Does day of week or time of day impact prices?
4.	Which of the rows have a price greater than the average of all prices in the dataset?
